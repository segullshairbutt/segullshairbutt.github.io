    "about": "I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with over five years of experience in building web and mobile applications. I am passionate about my work because I love the process of turning a complex idea into a functional tool that people can actually use. \n\nThis drive keeps me curious and motivated to learn new things every day, whether it’s finding a better way to organize code or helping my team work more efficiently. I take pride in being a reliable developer who focuses on quality and ensures that every project I work on is built to last. \n\n I enjoy being part of a team where we can share knowledge and push each other to do our best work. Outside of my professional life, I like to stay busy with creative side projects and enjoy exploring new places and staying active to keep a fresh perspective.",
